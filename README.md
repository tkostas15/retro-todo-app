# Intro

This is small todo app developed with ReactJs and Vite for practice purposes.

It consists of an 'add' button that opens up a modal, in which the user can type in any text.  
This text can be submitted and displayed inside a table that contains all the user's todos.

It is designed to match the retro synthwave style.

The project does not contain state management.

## Packages

For the modal, the `Formik` package was used in order to create a form with a single text input.  
For the table, I used the version 8 of `React Table` by TanStack.
